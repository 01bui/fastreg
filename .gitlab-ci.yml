# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The CI pipeline is divided into the following stages:
# Lint: Performs linter checks on the repo's code
# Build: Builds the project
# Test: Runs the project's tests
# Deploy: Deploys the project to a given directory
# Cleanup: Removes all artifacts required for the CI stages
stages:
  - Setup
  - Lint
  - Build
  - Test
  - Deploy
  - Cleanup

# env_setup defines a number of environment variables which can be called by
# various before_scripts of the project.
# 1) Exporting the PATH is necessary to enable linking of the custom installed
#    binaries in the group's shared directory.
# 2) setup.sh makes sure all Cuda related binaries are setup correctly.
#    This includes, but isn't limited to, CUDA itself and OpenGL.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The Setup stage sets all the nevironment variables and paths using cmake.

# > cmake <
# Cmake will generate a Makefile for the project linking all needed dependencies
# Cmake stage is required to not fail, in which case it would fail the pipeline.

  stage: Setup

  # Before attempting to cmake env variables must be set to link the binaries

  # Cmake requires two additional flags:
  # 1) CMAKE_PREFIX enables it to find the custom built binaries
  # 2) CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS are necessary to be set as otherwise BASH doesn't seem to
  #    set the c++ standard correctly (i.e. will throw a number of errors)
  # 3) [Others]

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# The Lint stage runs the linter on the project's files.

# > clang_format <
# Clang formatting will ensure that the latest files have been formatted with
# clang-styling. This step does not fix linter errors, it will just point them
# out to the pipeline, failing it.

# > lint <
# The linter used for the project is clang-tidy.
# 1) Linting stage must run after build due to the numerous dependencies created
#    by Cmake. All these dependencies are logged into compile_commands.json and
#    are referenced by clang-tidy when linting (i.e. to scan headers).
# 2) The run-clang-tidy python script must be linked to the relevant clang-tidy
#    executable as it cannot be found in it's canonical place (i.e /usr/bin).
# 3) run-clang-tidy.py will accept all clang-tidy flags, it has extra value as
#    it can use the compile_commands.json information.
#
# USED FLAGS:
# 1) -list-checks : Lists all the enabled checks.
# 2) -checks= : Sets different checkstyles for the source files
# 3) -p <DIR> : Sets the path for the build directory containing the
#               compile_commands.json information.
# 4) -warnings-as-errors=* : Treats all warnings as errors.
#
# Used checks can be found in .lintflags
